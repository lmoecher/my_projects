# Div

### Div Description 

* A "*div*" or *division* is an element used to group content on a webpage for organization. 
* Acts as a container for the other *HTML* elements, allowing the users to apply styles and layouts to the webpage effectively.
* A *div* is commonly used for layout structure, styling and theming, and for manipulation through *JavaScript*.

### Example

![Div Doc code IMG 1](img/div_doc_img_1.PNG "Div Doc code IMG 1")

### Output

![Div Doc code IMG 2](img/div_doc_img_2.PNG "Div Doc code IMG 2")

* These two paragraphs are group together because of being inside the div. 

## Centering a Div

* If a "*div*" is not 100% wide and want it centered. Set the CSS property *margin* to *auto*

### Example

### Output

![Div Doc code IMG 4](img/div_doc_img_4.PNG "Div Doc code IMG 4")

## Aligning a Div

* The most common way to align a *div* is to use the *float* property.
* The *float* property is used for positioning and formatting content.
* This shows each conatainer next to each other, rather than being stacked.
* The *flex* property can also be used, which makes it easier to design a responsive layout without using float.
* The *grid* property is one more that can be used instead. This designs the container with a grid, and the width of each column needs to be inputed.  

### Example using Float Property
